    <h1>Things to do in Madrid</h1>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Madrid is the capital and biggest city in Spain. Unlike Barcelona, tourism is not its main enterprise; it really is a city for living. Because of that, it‚Äôs the perfect place to absorb the Spanish way of life and get your ‚Äòculture fix‚Äô on your trip.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/26112120/madrid-29.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">Three days is the ideal time for all the top things to do in Madrid. However, if you have a few more days, stay a little longer and enjoy some fantastic day trips from Madrid to cities like Segovia, Toledo, or Valencia.</p>
    <h2>1. El Retiro Park</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">El Retiro Park is a beautiful slice of nature right at the city‚Äôs heart and a designated UNESCO world heritage site. Here you‚Äôll find beautiful wide-open gravel avenues in the shade of enormous horse chestnut, oaks, and cypress trees (more than 15,000 trees in the park). The oldest tree found here was planted back in 1633!</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104137/madrid-2.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">Take a wander through El Retiro, admiring all the beautiful statues, perfectly cut hedges, and rose gardens. In fact, the park used to belong to the Spanish royal family until it became public in the late 19th century. The grandeur of this park certainly makes it feel like it could still be the royal gardens, and it‚Äôs incredible to think this is a public resource for locals.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104208/madrid-5.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>Activities in El Retiro</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Madrile√±os come to enjoy the park in the evenings and at weekends, with everyone doing some form of exercise, from running to rollerblading. It‚Äôs the perfect place to relax under the shade of the trees, especially on Madrid‚Äôs longer, lighter summer evenings. Because of this, we recommend bringing a picnic and enjoying the late afternoon here after a busy morning of sightseeing.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/29130200/madrid-33.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">At the center of El Retiro, you can also discover a beautiful lake where you can hire boats and enjoy the park from the tranquility of the water. They even put on kayaking lessons here! Admire the beautiful palaces and the Alfonso XIII monument (the impressive columns that sit right in front of the lake).</p>
    <h3>El Retiro Opening Times</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">April to September 6 AM ‚Äì midnight and October ‚Äì March 6 AM to 10 PM.To get to El Retiro Park, take the metro to the ‚ÄòRetiro‚Äô station and walk from there.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/29131703/madrid-34.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h2>2. Palacio de Cristal in Madrid</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Palacio de Cristal (the glass palace) is located at the heart of El Retiro Park. In the shape of a Greek cross, this beautiful glass conservatory reaches a height of 22 meters and appears almost out over the water, surrounded by beautiful horse chestnut trees. In the fall, the stunning red and oranges of these colors is really something to see! </p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/29134005/madrid-36.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">The Palace used to be a greenhouse for beautiful flora and fauna. However, it‚Äôs now owned by the Reina Sofia Museum, which uses it as a unique space to hold art exhibitions throughout the year.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Best of all, it‚Äôs free to enter, so it‚Äôs a great thing to do in Madrid. Discover its beautiful ceramic tile floor and the exceptional glass and cast iron frame that holds the building up. Afterward, sit on the charming steps that lead from the Palace into the lake.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104223/madrid-6.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>Palacio Cristal Opening Times</h3>
    <h2>3. Atocha-Renfe Station in Madrid</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Most train stations worldwide aren‚Äôt really worth seeing, as they‚Äôre simply used to catch your train to the next destination. However, Atocha Station is the exception! This incredible station is home to a vast tropical garden filled with unique plants and trees that grow to enormous heights and almost reach the top of the station‚Äôs roof arch. It‚Äôs strange to see this jungle in an industrial station interior, making it one of the most unique things to do in Madrid! </p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104026/madrid-7.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">The botanical gardens contain over 7000 plants that originate from all over the globe, from places like Asia, South America, and Australia. There are also information signs so you can learn more about each plant.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong> It‚Äôs a free thing to do in Madrid. Alternatively, if you‚Äôre traveling somewhere in Spain, arrive at the station 30 minutes early to enjoy the view of this garden.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/30131713/madrid-49-540x810.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h2>4. Street Art </h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">With some of the greatest art museums in the world housed in Madrid, it‚Äôs no surprise that it‚Äôs a creative city. Street art is all around, some being more obvious, for example, huge murals covering buildings‚Äô sides. Other works are more discreet, like the miniature artworks or sculptures you‚Äôll find hidden down small streets or on doorways.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/29144040/madrid-43.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">This is another free thing to do in Madrid, an excellent activity for modern art lovers, and the ideal way to explore various neighborhoods in Madrid. Some of the best areas are Malasana, La Latina, and Embajadores.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong> If you want to learn more about the stories behind individual pieces, book an organized street art tour.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104040/madrid-9.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h2>5. San Miguel Market</h2>
    <p  style="font-size: large;">The San Miguel Market has been around since the early 1900s as a food market. Now, it‚Äôs known for its gourmet food stalls; it‚Äôs even home to Michelin star chefs who bring their offerings here! It‚Äôs a fantastic place to try some of the finest delicacies in Madrid (and from all over Spain!). Whether it‚Äôs tasty Jamon Iberico or the finest Spanish olives and oysters, there is something for all tastebuds.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/30123619/madrid-45.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">

    <p style="font-size: large;">Here over the weekend? The El Rastro flea market is the place to be in Madrid! This huge market fills the streets of the La Latina neighborhood from 9 AM to 3 PM every Sunday. Discover antiques, old books, comics, records, vintage clothing, furniture, plants, and more!</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25141200/madrid-22.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">Spend a few hours here gathering some souvenirs from your trip, like typical Spanish ceramic bowls or tiles, or stop at one of the many lovely tapas places on the hills and people watch. </p>
    <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong>Most stalls don‚Äôt accept cards, so make sure to bring cash with you (be ready to bargain!). It‚Äôs worth learning a few Spanish phrases to help you with the experience.</p></blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25141113/madrid-19.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h2>7. Reina Sofia Museum</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The Reina Sofia Museum is a modern, contemporary art center, home to the works of some of the greatest artists like Dali and Picasso. People come from all over the world to see Picasso‚Äôs famous piece ‚ÄòGuernica‚Äô (Picasso was born in Malaga). Not only is the art amazing, but the building is beautiful too; the grand white neoclassical building was once a hospital but now houses the museum. </p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25141035/madrid-17.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>Entry Fee & Opening Times</h3>

    <h2>8. Plaza Mayor</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Plaza Mayor (main square) is the most famous square in all of Madrid, situated in one of the oldest parts of the city. It‚Äôs a huge space, measuring 129 meters long and 94 meters wide, used as a meeting point for locals and a place to enjoy a drink in the evening.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25143154/madrid-24.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">Walk through the archway (nine arches in total provide entrance to the square) into a vast courtyard surrounded by terracotta red palatial buildings. After wandering around, enjoy a drink on the terrace in the sun, and get some beautiful photos. There are many restaurants to choose from but be aware that prices are significantly marked up here. </p>
    <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong>At Christmas, a fantastic market is held at Plaza Mayor. If you‚Äôre visiting during this time, enjoy the many stalls surrounding the giant Christmas tree at the center.</p></blockquote>

    <h2>9. Caixa Forum Museum Vertical Garden</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The Caixa Forum Museum Vertical Garden is one of the most exciting things to do in Madrid. What was once a power station is now a modern art gallery, complete with a vertical green garden that covers the exterior wall. This interactive garden allows people to touch the 78-foot wall, feel the different textures, and see the 300 different plant species growing here. </p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/26112134/madrid-31.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">The garden was designed by Patrick Blanc, who is famous for creating these sorts of vertical gardens throughout Europe. It‚Äôs certainly impressive when you consider Madrid‚Äôs hot, dry summer and the amount of care it takes to keep the garden this green and luscious. In fact, there is no soil on the wall at all, and the plants miraculously survive without it!</p>
    <h3>Opening Times and Entry Fee</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Open Monday to Sunday 10 AM ‚Äì 8 PM. It‚Äôs free to see the vertical garden and 6 EUR for the museum.</p>
    <h2>10. Palacio Real</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The Palacio Real (the Royal Palace) is easily the grandest building in Madrid, surrounded by wide open squares and elegant gardens. You can also see incredible views of the countryside surrounding Madrid from the terrace level. Additionally, you‚Äôll get the ambiance of musicians and street artists who come to the square to make money, creating an enjoyable, lively atmosphere.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/29141457/madrid-41.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>Visiting Palacio Real</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">It‚Äôs worth paying for a ticket to enter the Palacio Real as it‚Äôs the largest Palace in western Europe, with nearly 3500 rooms inside! Unusually, it‚Äôs also open to the public despite still being the head of the state‚Äôs residency.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/29141427/madrid-39.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <p style="font-size: large;">Enjoy the ancient exterior and interior, which go back to the 18th century (although the Palace sits on the old site of the medieval Palace that dates back to the 1500s). Visitors can also explore the lavishly decorated rooms with crystal chandeliers, such as the grand armory and the red velvet grandeur of the throne room.</p>
    <h3>Opening Times and Entry Fee</h3>
    <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;">Tickets cost 12 EUR. You can also book a guided tour for more information about the Palace‚Äôs history.</p></blockquote>
    <h2>11. Wander the Streets of Madrid</h2>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Arguably one of the best things to do in Madrid is get lost in the maze of beautiful streets. Around every corner, you‚Äôll find a new neighborhood, each with its own unique and distinct character. For example, the hipster district of Malasana, the narrow bar-filled lanes of Chueca, or the steep hills of la Latina and Lavapies. Some of the best neighborhoods to enjoy are:</p>
    <h3>Chueca</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The gay neighborhood of Madrid is one of the best and liveliest places to go out, with loads of fun bars and squares where people enjoy tapas and drinks.</p>

    <h3>Malasana</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Malasana is the hipster neighborhood of Madrid, filled with beautiful apartments, vintage stores, and a great alternative music scene. Many young people and students hang out here in the evenings, and there‚Äôs a vibrant, exciting atmosphere.    </p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25141217/madrid-23.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>Lavapies</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Lavapies is a melting pot of culture, a cosmopolitan neighborhood where people gather from all walks of life. Wander its narrow streets, discovering excellent Indian restaurants and sweet squares spilling down the hills where people enjoy a cheap bite to eat. </p>
    <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong>Head for a drink at Sala Equis. It used to be an adult cinema but is now a cool urban space where you can grab a drink.</p></blockquote>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104110/madrid-10.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>La Latina</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">La Latina is brimming with history, built on the site of an ancient Islamic fort. Discover its cute churches and steep cobbled hills filled with tapas restaurants. It‚Äôs a buzzing place on a Saturday and Sunday when the streets are filled with young people and families alike. It‚Äôs also home to the El Rastro flea market.</p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25143223/madrid-26.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h3>Barrio de Las Letras</h3>
    <p style="font-size: large;">The literary neighborhood of Barrio de Las Letras is a place famous for novels and writers, full of charming bookstores, with a distinctly bohemian feel. You‚Äôll find the Plaza de Santa Ana and nearby the Calle de las Huertas, full of fun bars at its centre. What‚Äôs great about Barrio de Las Letras is that many small streets are pedestrianized, so it‚Äôs perfect for walking around. Plus, it‚Äôs a little quieter than other neighborhoods. </p>
    <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/25104056/madrid-3.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
    <h2>12. Cerro del Tio Pio</h2>    
    <p style="font-size: large;">What is a city trip without an epic sunset view? Cerro del Tio Pio (known as the park of the seven tits) is a beautiful hilltop park just on the edge of the city. It used to be a waste disposal site, so its uneven ground has created lots of small hills for you to sit and enjoy the views of Madrid. Come at sunset for a buzzing atmosphere and some beautiful scenery! </p>
    <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong>Sunset views can also be found from many rooftop bars in Madrid‚Äôs city center. You‚Äôll pay a high price to access these terraces, but the views are fantastic.</p></blockquote>

    <p style="font-size: large;">There are loads of awesome neighborhoods in Madrid, from the cool Malasana to the multicultural Lavapies, where you‚Äôll find lots of great budget accommodation options. However, lots of people choose to stay in the central area of Salamanca, where you‚Äôll find lots of high-end shops and restaurants.

    <h1>Best Time to Visit Madrid</h1>    
    <p style="font-size: large;">Madrid is a city of contrasts: the winters are very cold, and the summers exceptionally dry and hot. Many local residents leave Madrid in the summer to go to the coast. Because of this, the city becomes quiet, many restaurants close and it can be hard to walk around and see the sights. </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">For this reason, early spring is a lovely time to visit Madrid or the shoulder months of September/October. Christmas is also a great time to tick off the top things to do in Madrid and see the Spanish Christmas markets and lights, as long as you‚Äôre ok with the cold!</p>
