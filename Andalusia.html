        <h1>Andalusia Road Trip Itinerary</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Andalusia is one of the greatest places to road trip. The drives are beautiful, crossing a diverse range of landscapes‚Äîbetween canyons, under viaducts, and on coastal roads. Two weeks is the ideal amount of time to see all the charming white villages of Andalusia that sit among the hilltops, as well as the most famous cities and beaches in Spain.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/26112120/madrid-29.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">Whether it‚Äôs action or relaxation, there‚Äôs something for every type of traveler on this 2-week road trip itinerary (best done by car for ultimate freedom). </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/02155813/granada-spain-6.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 1-2: Seville</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">On day 1 of your Andalusia road trip, begin in one of the most stunning cities in Spain: Seville. This city is famous for the Alcazar, an incredible Moorish palace with the most intricate details and beautiful gardens.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/22091217/seville-spain-15.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">This is your first glimpse of the Moorish history in Spain, an Islamic reign that lasted hundreds of years from the 8th until the 15th century before the country was reconquered by the Christians. This part of history lives on in the architecture seen all around Spanish cities, particularly in the southern region of Andalusia. </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/22090945/seville-spain-4.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">You‚Äôll also notice this architecture at Seville Cathedral, which still looks more like a mosque than a church. It‚Äôs also possible to climb the bell tower (minaret) for the most beautiful panoramic views over the city. </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/23132244/seville-spain-28.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">Aside from learning about the rich history of Seville, it‚Äôs a beautiful city to wander and explore. Everywhere you go, you‚Äôll smell the strong scent of Sevillan oranges among the trees, hear the sound of flamenco dancing, and see the traditional Andalusian courtyards with their gorgeous tilework and fountains.  </p>
        <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tips:</strong>Seville is well-connected to other major cities in Spain, like Barcelona or Madrid, so you can arrive in the city by train if traveling from an international airport.</p></blockquote>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/22090857/seville-spain-1.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Where to Stay in Seville</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">If you‚Äôre visiting in the summer, we recommend booking a hotel with a rooftop pool and aircon to escape the heat in the afternoons when temperatures can reach upwards of 40¬∞C (104¬∞F). The more modern hotels with these amenities are just outside of the center. If this isn‚Äôt essential for you, look for a traditional boutique hotel in the historic center of Seville, which normally have the traditional inner courtyards and Moorish architectural details. See all hotels in Seville.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/24105047/seville-spain-42.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 3: Cordoba </h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Wonderful Cordoba: the city of flowers! This city might be small, but it‚Äôs perfect as a stopover on your Andalusia road trip. One day is the ideal amount of time to wander the beautiful streets, admiring the many patios (courtyards) filled with vibrant-colored flowers and blue ceramic pots.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10142404/cordoba-spain-10.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p  style="font-size: large;">If you‚Äôre visiting in May, watch the city come alive during the Festival de los Patios, a competition for the best florally-decorated courtyard in the city! In fact, this festival is so important that it‚Äôs been classified as an ‚Äòintangible heritage‚Äô by UNESCO.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10141552/cordoba-spain-5.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">There are many beautiful buildings to see in Cordoba, but the most famous is the Mezquita (the cathedral of Cordoba). This is one of the most incredible cathedrals we‚Äôve ever seen! What was once a mosque during Moorish times is now a cathedral.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">However, barely any changes have been made, and it‚Äôs home to some of the most magnificent Islamic architecture you‚Äôll find in Spain. The interior is fantastic, with perfect archways decorated in red and white candy-cane stripes.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10143252/cordoba-spain-11.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Where to Stay in Cordoba </h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Cordoba is home to lots of beautiful boutique hotels, which can be found in the historic center. Make sure to book well in advance if you‚Äôre planning on traveling to the city during May, as the festival means that accommodation gets booked up fast and is far more expensive than usual. Another good time to visit is April, when the patios will nearly be ready for the fiesta, but it won‚Äôt be as busy.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10144503/cordoba-spain-4.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 4 + 5: Granada (Must-do on your Andalusia Road Trip)</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Arrive on day 4 in Granada, the most magical city in Spain. Not many cities can boast this kind of scenery; the ancient city is surrounded by snow-topped mountains and has a beautiful river that trickles down into the town.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/02154636/granada-spain-10.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">In the background, sitting on top of the cliffside, and shadowed by the mountains, is the majestic Alhambra Palace (one of the most famous sites in all of Spain).</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/02154605/granada-spain-3.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">This colossal fortress complex was once the home of the ruler of the Nasrid dynasty (during the Moorish period in Spain), and every detail is spectacular. You need a half-day alone just to walk among its opulent buildings and gardens filled with roses and orange trees. </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03102846/granada-spain-7.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">After your time sightseeing, get lost in the maze-like streets of the old town, paddle in the river off the hillside Albaicin neighborhood, or eat free tapas (in Granada, you get a free plate of tapas with every drink you purchase). </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04115251/granada-spain-29.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Where to Stay in Granada</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Stay in the historical center close to the cathedral to easily access the city‚Äôs shops, restaurants, and most ancient buildings. Albaicin is also a lovely neighborhood to stay in, particularly as it has excellent views of the city below and across the river to Alhambra.</p>
        <h1>Potential Day Trips from Granada: Iznajar + Montefrio</h1>
        <h2>Iznajar</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Iznajar has one of the most picturesque locations, sitting high up on a hilltop overlooking an open valley and lake below. It‚Äôs most famous for its beautiful streets and patios, which are decorated with hundreds of flowerpots and brightly colored geraniums.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/05092319/granada-spain-36.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">This tiny village is mainly home to elderly local people, so the pace of life is slow (it‚Äôs the perfect place to wander for a few hours and soak up the atmosphere of Spanish life!). Best of all, Iznajar is just over 1-hour drive from Granada, so it is the ideal half-day trip from the city.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/05091629/granada-spain-35.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h2>Montefrio</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Montefrio is a hilltop town home to the ruins of an ancient Moorish castle. The views from here are unparalleled, so much so that National Geographic voted Montefrio as one of the top 10 views in the world! Visit the fortress to reach the highest point of the village, followed by a walk to the National Geographic viewpoint, where you can see a direct view of Montefrio sprawled across the hillside. It‚Äôs truly one of the most beautiful villages in Spain and the perfect place to visit at sunset.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/26092409/andalusia-spain-1.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 6 + 7: Frigiliana + Nerja</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">It‚Äôs time to head for the beach! This strip of coastline is named ‚ÄòCosta del Sol‚Äô, meaning sunshine coast, and it lives up to its name. This area has many beautiful resorts and villages, but Frigiliana and Nerja are some of the loveliest.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/28140854/andalusia-spain-4.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h2>Nerja</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Nerja sits on a clifftop overlooking the ocean, with fantastic views of the coves and coastline below. It‚Äôs the perfect place to stay for the night, with many lovely hotels, restaurants, and shops.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20103911/malaga-spain-19.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h2>Frigiliana</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">From Nerja, you can drive to Frigiliana in under 15 minutes. This beautiful whitewashed mountain town is one of the most photogenic spots on your Andalusia 2-week road trip. Cobbled streets worm uphill, bordered by white houses with painted doorways and flower pots.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20103923/malaga-spain-20.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">You could spend a few hours just getting lost in the streets, taking photos of each beautiful entranceway, and shopping in all the cute ceramic shops. We recommend booking dinner here one evening as many restaurants have terraces where you can sit and enjoy fantastic views of the valley below.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/28135917/andalusia-spain-2.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Where to Stay</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">There are more accommodation options in Nerja, and you can easily access the beaches if you‚Äôd like to swim or sunbathe. If you want to stay in a villa, Frigiliana has many pool options, but you‚Äôll need to book ahead as it‚Äôs very popular. </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/28135932/andalusia-spain-3.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 8 ‚Äì 9: Malaga (Half-Way on Your Andalusia Road Trip)</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Welcome to dynamic Malaga, a beachside city with a picture-perfect old town. You can find almost everything in Malaga, whether it‚Äôs castles, museums, galleries (Malaga was the birthplace of Picasso), or street art. It‚Äôs also home to some of the best restaurants and cafes in Andalusia! </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/08152519/malaga-spain-2.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">Exploring the sights of the old town is a must-do on your 2-week Andalusia road trip, for example, the Alcazaba and the Castillo de Gibralfaro, which are both historical monuments with beautiful views of the city. If you have time, we also recommend taking a half-day trip to the Caminito del Rey, one of Spain‚Äôs most thrilling hikes.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20105440/malaga-spain-21-538x810.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Where to Stay in Malaga</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Stay in the old town to be near some of Malaga‚Äôs most historic and beautiful buildings. Alternatively, if you want more of a beach break, there are plenty of great hotels next to the ocean, which are still within walking distance of the city center.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/19214238/malaga-spain-10.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 10 ‚Äì 11: Ronda</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Beautiful Ronda is a place famous throughout Spain for its iconic bridge that hangs over the canyon. The town itself almost looks as if it is balancing precariously on top of the gorge, providing some of the most incredible views out over the Andalusian landscapes.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/20103220/ronda-spain-6.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">There are several viewpoints to see the bridge (Puente Neuvo) at its finest: either from below, the lovely Jardines de Cuenca, or the Mirador de Aldehuela. Grab your camera and take some incredible photos from these locations. </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/20103416/ronda-spain-3.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <p style="font-size: large;">In the late afternoon/evening, take some time to explore the town of Ronda, whether it‚Äôs the main street with its boutique shops or the pretty churches and ancient Arab baths. Ronda is magical and will steal your heart! </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/21135249/ronda-spain-24.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Where to Stay in Ronda</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">The main draw to Ronda is the incredible views from the top of the Tajo Gorge. For this reason, many hotels sit on top of the gorge looking out over the valley, so you‚Äôll be spoilt for choice regarding accommodation.</p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/20151728/ronda-spain-1.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Day 12: Seville (End of your Andalusia Road Trip)</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Day 12 is the final day of your Andalusia road trip itinerary, and what a trip it‚Äôs been! From charming white villages nestled among the hilltops to beautiful coastal towns and Moorish cities, you‚Äôve seen some of the most beautiful places in Spain. Drive back to Seville (1 hour 20 minutes) to drop your hire car and head home. You might even have time to squeeze in one last Spanish meal before your train or flight!</p>
        <blockquote><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tip:</strong>Seville has an airport with flights leaving to major cities in Spain, as well as France and beyond. If you‚Äôre looking to travel further afield, take a train from Seville back to major cities like Barcelona, Madrid, or Malaga, where you‚Äôll find international airports with more flights.</p></blockquote>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/25154258/Setenil-de-las-Bodegas-10.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>How to visit Andalusia in 2 weeks</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Andalusia is a massive region in southern Spain, with countless beautiful villages, hikes, and cities to explore. You could easily spend a month or more slowly working your way around the region. However, 2 weeks is the ideal amount of time to see the majority of Andalusia‚Äôs highlights. This Andalusia road trip itinerary (2 weeks) is designed to be done by car, although it is possible to use public transport (with a bit more planning). </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/03104540/granada-spain-12.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">
        <h1>Getting to Andalusia</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">There are a few airports in Andalusia. However, Malaga is the biggest, with flights arriving from all over Europe as well as internal flights from other bigger cities in Spain.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">If you‚Äôre flying into Barcelona or Madrid, consider taking the train to Andalusia. There are many high-speed, direct options that will get you to Malaga, Granada, or Seville in a matter of hours.</p>
        <h1>Getting Around Andalusia on your 2-week Road Trip</h1>
        <h2>By Car</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">The best way to experience Andalusia is by car. The region is vast and very remote, meaning you‚Äôll have greater freedom to reach the small villages and rural nature if you can drive. </p>
        <h2>By Bus</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">It is possible to travel by bus in Andalusia, but not all the destinations on this itinerary have public transport connections. You might have to make changes or take taxis to reach the more remote parts of Andalusia.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Buses move between the major cities and towns in Andalusia and are usually very cheap and comfortable. Make sure to do your research in advance as to whether you need to pre-book or can pay by cash on arrival. </p>
        <h2>By Train</h2>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Trains link major cities in Andalusia, as well as some towns. For example, Seville, Malaga, Granada, and Cordoba. However, you won‚Äôt be able to reach any of the white villages by train. </p>
        <img src="https://static.saltinourhair.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/04105132/granada-spain-26.jpg" alt="" height="600px" width="700">

        <h1>How Much Do 2-Weeks in Andalusia Cost?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Andalusia is one of the cheapest regions in Spain. Eating out is very reasonable, and in some cities, tapas is even free! What‚Äôs more, book ahead, and you can find beautiful hotels for a fraction of the price you‚Äôd find in bigger cities like Madrid or Valencia.</p>

        <h1>Best Time to Visit Andalusia</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">The most popular time to visit Andalusia is during the summer when you can make the most of the beautiful beaches and warm Mediterranean ocean. However, be aware that the summer months are very busy and can be more expensive (particularly in August when the Spanish take their holidays). These are also the hottest months when temperatures in places like Cadiz and Seville can exceed 40¬∞C (104¬∞F). Because of this, it‚Äôs not the best time for city sightseeing.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">Instead, we recommend visiting in the shoulder seasons of late spring or early autumn. You‚Äôll still get warm temperatures and beautiful sunny days, but it‚Äôll be much more comfortable for sightseeing and road-tripping. Temperatures can be in the high 20s as late as the end of October! </p>

        <h1>Travel Insurance for your Andalusia Road Trip</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">It‚Äôs always a good idea to purchase single-trip travel insurance, even if you‚Äôre only traveling for 2 weeks in Andalusia. This covers the potential for any accidents or loss, for example, theft of baggage, canceled flights, or a road accident.</p>
        <p style="font-size: large;">We use Heymondo for all our trips, as they have very responsive customer service and a 24-hour online chat where you can speak with medical professionals.</p>
        <h1>Things to Know About Andalusia</h1>
        <p style="font-size: large;">There are a few things you can learn about Andalusia that will make your trip run a little more smoothly:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Tap water is safe to drink</strong>in Andalusia. It is quite chlorinated, which can make it taste a little different from what you‚Äôre used to. However, drinking is safe, so bring your reusable water bottle and travel plastic-free! </p></li>
            <li><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Siesta time.</strong>During the summer, all shops and restaurants close for siesta (typically somewhere between 4 PM ‚Äì 8 PM). On Sundays, most conveniences are also shut.</p></li>
            <li><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Pubic holidays.</strong>Spain is a country with some of the highest number of public holidays in the world! This means there is always a fiesta somewhere, so make sure to check ahead for shop, restaurant, and road closures.</p></li>
            <li><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Hot summer temperatures.</strong>n August, temperatures can exceed 40¬∞C (104¬∞F). Make sure to plan your sightseeing in the early mornings or evenings to avoid being in the sun (the hottest time of day is usually around 4 PM). Make sure to wear a hat and sunscren, and drink plenty of water.</p></li>
            <li><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Always carry cash,</strong>especially in small villages where sometimes card is not accepted.</p></li>
            <li><p style="font-size: large;"><strong>Bring extra layers</strong>if you‚Äôre traveling in the mountains, as it can get cooler in the evenings. </p></li>
